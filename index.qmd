## Welcome!

I’m Olivia, a post-doc at Yale School of Medicine in the department of Medical Oncology. My research under the mentorship of Lucia Jilaveanu is focused on identifying and characterizing novel molecular mediators contributing to melanoma brain metastasis. I run gels to answer scientific questions and run marathons to keep myself sane.
