## Background

I received my PhD from the University of Kansas School of Medicine in the department of Cancer Biology, and my bachelor's in biology and pre-medicine from William Jewell College. As a molecular cancer biologist by training, my work integrates molecular biology, functional genomics, and quantitative data analysis to study tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms to uncover clinically relevant mediators of cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.

## Hobbies
Outside of the lab, I spend my time with my husband, our son, and our two dogs. We’re usually outside—running, hiking local trails, or just walking the neighborhood to unwind. I also love coffee (the ones with fruity notes) and drink arguably too much of it, and travelling back to my hometown of Kansas City to visit family and friends whenever possible.
