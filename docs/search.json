    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

Our studies revealed that PDCD4 is unique in that it is expressed by and correlated with immune cell infiltration in MBM. Our additional tumor profiling studies in MBM identified that PDCD4 expression in CD3+ T-cells correlates with features of cytotoxicity and is a predictor of MBM free survival and response to current immunotherapies. The exact role of PDCD4 in MBM and if/how PDCD4 mediates the interactions between tumor and immune cells in MBM are currently unknown."

    "section": "Mediators of melanoma brain metastasis",
    "text": "Mediators of melanoma brain metastasis\nAmong solid tumors, melanoma has the highest propensity to metastasize to the brain and melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are responsible for &gt;50% of melanoma related deaths. An abundance of therapies have been developed for patients with extra-cerebral melanoma metastases, but not for patients with melanoma brain metastases (MBM). Only a subset of patients respond to immunotherapy and resistance often develops. These challenges highlight an urgent need to identify regulators of MBM to improve current therapies. However, there is a gap in understanding the brain metastatic process due to an exceedingly limited number of studies and experimental models. My post-doctoral fellowship has been focused on developing and utilizing novel methods to investigate mechanisms of melanoma brain metastases. Two of the main projects are described below.\n\nVasculogenic mimicry in MBM\nOne way to investigate metastatic mechanisms is to identify intrinsic mechanisms of tumor cells. We identified Vascular mimicry (VM), a form of non angiogenic neovascularization generated by trans-differentiation of tumor cells into vascular endothelial-like cells, is preferred by MBM over traditional angiogenesis. Notably, VM is linked to invasion, early stages of micrometastatic outgrowth, drug resistance and patient overall survival. This study suggests that VM in melanoma brain metastasis could be an important mechanism used by tumor cells when angiogenesis is inadequate to overcome the non-permissive and poorly vascularized microenvironmental pressure of the brain. Additionally, VM may be an underlying cell program unique to a subpopulation of melanoma cells with the competency to not only disseminate to the brain, but to generate metastatic lesions. Moreover, utilization of anti-YAP/TAZ therapy in mouse models of metastatic melanoma significantly inhibits VM formation and prolongs survival, suggesting that targeting VM may be a strategy for treating MBM. Lastly, as angiogenic inhibitors do not inhibit VM formation, we conclude VM formation and blood vessel density are independent, and possibly compensatory mechanisms. My work on this project project has resulted in a first-place poster at the Yale post-doc symposium (2025), and a first-author manuscript.\n\n\nProgrammed cell death 4 (PDCD4)\nPrior to me joining Dr. Lucia Jilaveanu’s research group at Yale University, pre-clinical investigations from the lab identified PLEKHA5, a protein involved in normal brain development, as a mediator of melanoma growth in the brain. Mechanistically, PLEKHA5 downregulates the tumor suppressor molecule, programmed cell death-4 (PDCD4), which we now hypothesize to be a likely suppressor of MBM. PDCD4 is a known tumor suppressor in numerous tissue types as its expression is often lost during the transformation from benign to malignant cancer, PDCD4 has emerged as a regulator of the inflammatory process and our studies suggest a potential role of PDCD4 in T-cell function, though the functional relevance of this finding in melanoma metastasis is unknown. My work on this project included methods such as generating a knockout mouse model, cytokine profiling, multi-color flow cytometry, and numerous molecular biology techniques. While I cannot share the details at the moment as a manuscript submission is under review, my work on this project has resulted in a 2-year fellowship awarded by Yale Center for Clinical Investigation, a Blue Ribbon abstract at the Association of Clinical and Translational Science conference, and a first author manuscript (under review)."

My work highlights the true complexity of cancer and the importance of understanding the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic cellular dynamics."
